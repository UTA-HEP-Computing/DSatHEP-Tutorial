    "Our first two labs are intended to try to force everyone to learn sufficient python, numpy, and HDF5 to perform some basic tasks. As I started writing primers for these topics, I quickly found that there are many excellent primers already out there. So instead, these labs will just present you with various problems and point you to notebooks from other sources that will provide you the necessary background to solve the problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are seeing this page, you have successfully connected to our python server via ssh tunnel, logged in, and navigated to this notebook. Jupyter notebooks consist of cells that can hold text or code (usually python). This text that you are reading, was written into a text cell as simple text \"coding\" language known as mark-down. When this cell is run (either automatically at start of the notebook or manually by pressing control-enter), the mark-down text is interpreted into nice looking text. Running a code cell will execute the code in that cell and give you the results. If you make a mistake, you can usually simply change the cell and re-run. But be aware that since you ran the mistaken cell already, whatever code that was properly executed before your mistake/error, was already executed and has therefore changed your current python environment accordingly. In some cases this situation will be problematic, and you will need to rerun the notebook from the start by pressing the \"reload\" botton (next to the \"stop\" button) above.\n",

These are full lecture series, one on python (by Rajath Kumar from Indian Institute of Science, [License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) ) and one on scientific computing (by Robert Johansson, [License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) ), that I found in github. Feel free to google around for other sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "My suggestion is that you first read through this lab to get a sense of what you will need to know. This first lab requires just basic python. If you are unfamiliar with python or not comfortable, then take time during this lab to read enough of the following notebooks to get you started with the exercises, and then follow up at home to go through the rest of the material. Your homework, due 10 am Friday morning (so I can take a look before lecture), is to complete this full Lab. I will simply take a snapshot of your lab notebook at that time. \n",
