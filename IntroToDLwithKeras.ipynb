    "# An Introduction to Deep Learning with Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is meant to teach a beginning HEP under-graduate or graduate student who may be unfamiliar with python or data science in python to train Deep Learning models using Keras. Usually, tutorials attempt to familiarize you with a software package by leading you through the steps of a few tasks. Like most tutorials, there are many sections where you can simply follow the instructions and execute example code like a robot (usualy via copy/paste into a terminal, but in this case using Jupyter notebooks). But this tutorial also aims to teach you key concepts in scientific computing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning in python through exercises that require you to slow down, think critically, and apply what you read. The exercises were derived from labs for a Deep Learning in HEP course for undergrads (taught at University of Texas at Arlington by Amir Farbin).  \n",

While you can run the session in a terminal, Jupyter provides a nice web-based alternative environment for data analysis.

Jupyter notebooks consist of cells that can hold text or code (usually python). This text that you are reading, was written into a text cell as simple text \"coding\" language known as mark-down. When this cell is run (either automatically at start of the notebook or manually by pressing shift-enter), the mark-down text is interpreted into nice looking text. Running a code cell will execute the code in that cell and give you the results. If you make a mistake, you can usually simply change the cell and re-run. But be aware that since you ran the mistaken cell already, whatever code was properly executed before your mistake/error, was already executed and has therefore changed your current python environment accordingly. In some cases this situation will be problematic, and you will need to rerun the notebook from the start by pressing the \"reload\" botton (next to the \"stop\" button) above.\n",
