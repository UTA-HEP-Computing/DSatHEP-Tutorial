    "**Calorimetry and the LCD Detector**\n",
    "\n",
    "In high energy physics, detectors are used to take 'images' of particles that may result from controlled particle collisions (such as the Large Hadron Collider), single beams of known particles (such as test beams or neutrino beams), or influxes of particles from natural sources (such as solar neutrinos). These images are taken by advanced technologies exploiting the different methods in which particles interact with matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The calorimeter is one class of detectors that is used to capture (aka reconstruct) the energy of passing particles. This is done by using materials that the particles will interact with, essentially emitting energy in this exchange, and materials that can tell us the amount of energy that is lost. Through consecutive processes of interactions and energy loss the goal is for particles to effectively stop in the material and for the reconstructed energy to be a measure of the initial energy of the particle.  For example in the ATLAS detector, one calorimeter system uses plates of steel (a dense material) to 'slow down and stop' the passing particles inside the calorimeter, alternating with plates of plastic scintillator that ionize as these high energy particles pass. The photons emitted during the ionization process are collected onto photomultiplier tubes which convert the photon into an electrical signal representative of the lost energy. As particles interact with the calorimeter showers of secondary particles are produced, themselves interacting with the material, and so on. In particle physics experiments the purpose of the calorimeter is to precisely reconstruct the energy and identification of initial particle initiating this shower.      \n",
    "One potential future high energy physics experiment is an electron-positron linear collider. R&D is underway to design and build that accelerator facility and associated detectors. The linear collider detector (LCD) is one of these proposed detectors. The LCD design includes the standard components including inner tracking detectors, calorimeters, and outer tracking systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis we will use simulations of the LCD calorimeter system, made up of an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and hadronic calorimeter (HCAL). The ECAL aims to fully reconstruct the energy from electrons, positrons, and photons, and to measure the initial energy of showers initiated by hadrons. The ECAL is highly granular (in this simulation broken down into 25x25x25 cells) to help differentiate between electron (positron) and photon particles by properties of their shower developments, and to help identify incoming photons that converted into electron-position pairs. The HCAL is highly granular along the longitudinal direction (in this simulation separated into 5x5x60 cells), giving more information about the longitudinal development of hadronic showers. The LCD calorimeters are non-compensating, meaning there are ways in which hadrons lose energy in the interactions that are not captured in the reconstruction of the electrical signal. Hence downstream software corrections must be applied to hadron showers to accurately reconstuct the initial hadron energy. The amount of the correction depends on several factors, including the initial particle energy and type. "

    "In this example simulated particles of either electrons, photons, neutral pions, or charged pions are shot directly into the LCD calorimeter systems. The cell level information (physical positions, energy deposited) is saved for the ECAL (25x25x25) and HCAL (5x5x60), thus saving a 3D image for each 'event' (event = single particle). The goal is to study the use of deep learning methods to improve the identification and reconstruction of these particles.   \n",

For fixed x and y values, the values for the energy deposted in each cell along the longitudinal direction (z) are summed and displayed in the 3rd axis. The color and size of a circle at a given x and y position represent the total amount of energy summed along the longitudinal direction. \n",
