    "## Introduction to Particle Detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In high energy physics experiments, detectors serve as cameras, taking pictures of particle interaction 'events' resulting from either natural sources (e.g. cosmic rays, solar neutrinos, radioactive decay, or Dark Matter), or in controlled particle collision arranged by crossing high energy particle beams (e.g. Large Hadron Collider (LHC) or the Tevatron) or shoot a single such beam in a target (e.g. Neutrino beam experiments at Fermilab). In most cases the particles of ultimate interest (e.g. Higgs, Supersymmetric particles, or neutrino) cannot be observed directly because they either decay immediately or are effectively invisible, and must therefore must be inferred from their decay products or secondary particles that result from their rare interactions. The images are taken by advanced technologies exploiting the unique processes by which these secondary particles interact with matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since charged particles ionize matter, their trajectories can be reconstructed by spatially locating ions, for example in silicon pixels like those in digitial cameras or in wires in liquid Argon. If these secondary particles are in a strong magentic field, the resulting curvature in their trajectories provide a measurement of their momenta. Momentum resolution degrades for highly energetic particles since the curvature in their trajectories are small and difficult to measure, necessitating very strong magnetic fields (i.e. the CMS design) or large volume of magnetic field (i.e. the ATLAS design). In addition, precision detectors enable particle trajectories to be traced to common vertexes that spatially locate the orgins of decays or interactions. Detectors that perform tracking charged particles in this way are knowns as Tracking Detectors. Tracking detectors are not the subject of this specific tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In dense material, nearly all particles will eventually loose in their energy in an avalanche of secondary particles, referred to as showers. For light particles that do not feel the strong force, such as photons and electrons, the showers are due to electromagetic interactions with the electrons in the interacting material. For heavier particles that do feel the strong force, such as neutrons or pions, the showers are due to hadronic interactions with the nuclei in the interaction material. In both cases, the fundamental processes governing these interactions are at relatively low energies compared to particle initiating the shower. As a result the number of particles in the shower is typically directly proportional to the energy of the primary particle and the energy resolution improves with energy, following poisson statistics (i.e. proportional to the $\\sqrt{E} \\approx \\sqrt{N}$). Calorimeters, which effectively just count the particles in these showers, usually come in two flavors, Electromagentic and Hadronic, corresponding to the two possible types of showers. Highly granular calorimeters measure energy in cells (analogous to voxels), enabling the particle showers to be 'imaged'. The ATLAS calorimeter has about 200,000 cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial presented here focuses on calorimeters and liquid and gas Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), which produce 2D and 3D images of the interactions of particles that in many cases can be easily identified by the human eye. We will use these images to classify the particle type, measure the particle energies, and generate new images for simulation. We ask participants to begin by choosing one type of detector that they find most compelling. In order to assist with this choice, the following sections overview the detectors and the possible Machine Learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Particles and their interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "The following particles live long enough to traverse particle detectors and therefore be observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Electrons/positrons: These leptons are charged and therefore leave tracks in tracking detectors. They produce dense showers in electromagnetic calorimeter with little energy reaching the hadronic calorimeter.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Photons: Having not charge, they leave no sign in the tracking detectors, unless the convert to electron/positron pair by interacting with some detector material (e.g. the tracker). They leave showers in the Electromagnetic calorimeter that resemble electron showers.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Neutral Pions: these immediately decay to two photons and are therefore detected as a pair of photons. As their energy goes up, the two photons begin to overlap thus making it difficult to separate single photon and neutron photon events.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * Muons/anti-muons: These heavier lepton cousins of electron are similarly charged and therefore leave tracks. But they are too heavy to deaccelerarte in the electromagnetic calorimeters and do not feel the strong force and so also don't shower in the hadronic calorimeters. They are the only particles that typically escape from the calorimeters and are therefore detected and identified by muon tracking systems that surround the other detectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Pions, Kaons, protons, neutrons and other hadrons: if charged, they leave tracks. They typically leave minimal energy in the electromagnetic calorimeters and shower in the hadronic calorimeter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calorimeters\n",
    "\n",
    "The Large Hadron Collider experiments use Electromagnetic Calorimeters to identify and measure energies of photons and electron, and use Hadronic Calorimeters to group and measure energy of jets of hadronic particles initiated by energetic quarks or gluons produced in the primary collisions. These calorimeters are designed to be as hermetic as possible, collecting all of the energy of every collision in order to measure inbalances that indicate the presence of non-interacting particles such as neutrinos or dark matter. Since the LHC collides protons, the collisions are dominated by strong interactions that produce quarks and gluons that turn into hadronic jets. These highly copious jets are the primary background to the identification of photons and lepton, which are much rarer. As a result, these Calorimeters are required to only mis-identify 1 in roughly 10000 jets as a photon or lepton. They achieve such performance by exploiting the differences between electromagnetic and hadronic showers, for example by using multi-variate techniques on features that encapsulate the shower profile such as the spatial moments of the energy deposits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even small improvement in the classification performance or energy resolution of Calorimeters can have a large effect on physics results, for example by reducing the backgrounds underneath the Higgs Mass peak or sharpening up the peak. A bigger impact on LHC experiments would come from faster faithful simulation of calorimeter interactions, an extremely CPU intensive task which currently relies on tracking and simulating the micro-physics of the thousands of particles in each event that traverse the calorimeter. For example of order one half of the computing resources of ATLAS experiment is used for just this one task. \n",
    "\n",
    "### LCD Calorimeter\n",
    "\n",
    "Since simulated calorimeter data from the LHC experiments are generally not public and are difficult to use due to the complexities of the hadronic colliders, we choose to begin our studies Deep Learning in calorimetry in a simpler calorimeter of the Linear Collider Detector (LCD), a R&D detector concept for a future potential accelerator facility. The LCD design includes the standard components including inner tracking detectors, calorimeters, and outer tracking systems. The LCD calorimeter is highly granular, imaging particle showers at much higher resolution than the current LHC experiments. But we can approximate the LHC calorimeters by down-sampling the LCD calorimeter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The highly granularity of LHC detector enables differentiation of electron (positron) and photon particles by properties of their shower developments, and identification of incoming photons that converted into electron-position pairs. The HCAL is highly granular along the longitudinal direction, giving more information about the longitudinal development of hadronic showers. The LCD calorimeters are non-compensating, meaning there are ways in which hadrons lose energy in the interactions that are not captured in the reconstruction of the electrical signal. Hence downstream software corrections must be applied to hadron showers to accurately reconstuct the initial hadron energy. The amount of the correction depends on several factors, including the initial particle energy and type. Hadronic calibration and resolution are often one of the dominating sources of uncertaintly and inaccuracy in physics measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of simulations of single electrons/positron, charged pion, neutral pions (pi0s), or photon (gamma) shot into the calorimeter. To keep the data size manageable, we only store a 25 by 25 by 25 cell part of the ECAL and 5 by 5 by 60 part of the HCAL around the particle. In addition we compute some typical features used in traditional calorimeter particle classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [LCD Data Notebook](LCDData.ipynb) introduces this dataset. [The LCD Classification Notebook](LCDClassification.ipynb) sets up a Deep Learning classification problem. Other iteresting problems that can be easily setup are energy regression and generative models for simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Neutrino Detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutrinos are extremely elusive particles. Every second, 100 billion neutrinos go through your thumb nail, but only one may interact in your body in your lifetime. Because of their elusiveness, we know relatively little about neutrinos, yet they may help explain the matter/anti-matter asymmetry in the Universe or give us a hit of physics beyond the Standard Model. Therefore the US has choosen to build an intense neutrino beam which will send neutrinos from Fermilab, through the earth, to unprecidentedly large detector more that 1 km under ground (in order to be shielded from Cosmic Rays). The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), US's flagship particle physics experiment, will begin taking neutrino data in the mid-2020s. In meantime current and up-coming short-baseline neutrino beam experiments are studying neutrinos. \n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting neutrinos requires instrumenting a large volume of material to observe the secondary particles produced when the neutrinos interact. Neutrinos come in three flavors: electron neutrino, muon neutrino, and tau neutrino. They interact in 2 ways via the weak force: charged current, which results in a of corresponding flavor, and neutral current, which doesn't reveal the flavor of the neutrino. Most neutrino experiments only require identifying the type of neutrino and measuring its energy. Several technologies have been employed for such experiments. One successful approach is to use liquid water or oil as the detector material. The secondary particles, which will typically go faster than speed of light in that material, will therefore emit Cherenkov light in a process analgous to sonic booms. This light produces rings on the walls of the detector than can be seen by photon detectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technology choosen for DUNE and the majority of recent and planned neutrino experiments is Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC), which promise twice the detection efficiency of previous techniques. In these detectors, the secondary particles ionize the Argon, which is kept in a strong electric field so that the ions do not recombine. This field causes the electrons to 'drift' to one side of the detector so they can be read out by 2 or 3 planes of parallel wires. Since the drift velocity is constant, the time of the arrival of the electrons at the wire corresponds to the distance from the wire. The location of the wire provides a second measurement of the drift electron position. Ploting wire position versus time for collected charge produces a 2D projected image of the neutrino interaction. 3D can be inferred by correlating images from 2 or 3 planes which are at angles wrt eachother. \n",
    "\n",
    "The extremely high resolution images produced by LArTPC detectors can be easily identified by the human eye. But, despite a great deal of effort by the LArTPC community, automatic reconstruction of LArTPC has proven to be difficult and a significant barrier to deriving physics results. In many cases, experiments have had to use people to identify events and help algorithms find patterns in a process known as a \"hand scan\". Convolutional Neural Networks have been shown to perform better than traditional algorithms in classification of neutrino events and particles in LArTPC. However these studies have only demonstrated feasibility on typically highly downsampled data. The goal of the tutorial here is to initiate the process of developing CNNs at full detector resolution and demonstrating classification and energy regression with performances on par with the expected capability of LArTPC detectors. It is noteworth that the success of DUNE and many of these projects rely on excellent performance on such tasks which have yet to be demonstrated, primarily due to software. \n",
    "\n",
    "### LArIAT Detector\n",
    "\n",
    "Argonut detector was the first LArTPC to see neutrino beams. It has been refurbished, renamed LArIAT, and is currently taking test beam data at Fermilab. This very small detector has 2 plane of 240 wires each, oriented at 60 degrees from the horizontal. Note that the DUNE experiment will have 1 million wires. Each LArIAT readout window consists of 4096 time sampling of each wire, producing two 240 by 4096 images. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the tutorial, we have produced 1 million LArIAT test beam events for each of the following: electrons/positrons, positive/negative/neutral pions, positive/negative kaons, muons/antimuons, electron/muon/tau neutrinos/anti-neutrinos charged/neutral current. In addition to particle type, the data labeled by the type of interaction and the particle in the final state. We also store the true 3D locations of charge deposits. The total data is rought 20TBs. Most studies have been performed by downsampling and scanning the data in time, producing 240 by 256 sized images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Achieving the design classification and energy regression within detectors would be a significant achievement. Other interesting problems include noise suppression and reconstructing 3D images from the two 2D images.\n",
